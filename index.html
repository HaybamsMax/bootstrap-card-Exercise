        <p class="card-text"> A kitten (also known as a kitty or kitty cat) is a juvenile cat. After being born, kittens
  are totally dependent on their mother for survival and they do not normally open their eyes until
  after seven to ten days. After about two weeks, kittens quickly develop and begin to explore the
  world outside the nest. After a further three to four weeks, they begin to eat solid food and grow
  adult teeth. Domestic kittens are highly social animals and enjoy human companionship.</p>

      <p class="card-text">Rabbits are small mammals in the family Leporidae of the order Lagomorpha, found
 in several parts of the world. There are eight different genera in the family classified as rabbits,
 including the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), cottontail rabbits (genus Sylvilagus; 13
 species), and the Amami rabbit (Pentalagus furnessi, an endangered species on Amami
 Ōshima, Japan). There are many other species of rabbit, and these, along with pikas and hares,
 make up the order Lagomorpha. The male is called a buck and the female is a doe; a young
 rabbit is a kitten or kit.</p>

      <p class="card-text">A puppy is a juvenile dog. Some puppies can weigh 1–3 lb (0.45–1.36 kg), while
 larger ones can weigh up to 15–23 lb (6.8–10.4 kg). All healthy puppies grow quickly after birth.
 A puppy's coat color may change as the puppy grows older, as is commonly seen in breeds
 such as the Yorkshire Terrier. In vernacular English, puppy refers specifically to dogs while pup
 may often be used for other mammals such as seals, giraffes, guinea pigs, or even rats.</p>
